# Music Information Processing: Audio
Some codes as part of a Music Info Processing course I took at IU in Fall '16.

Requires tuneR package

* __amazing_grace.r__: Creates the first 10 notes of Amazing Grace in the key of C with the correct ryhthm. A bagpipe feel is simulated by adding a low "drone" and grace notes having a reedy tone color.

* __amplitude_vibrato.r__: Creates a sine tone with "amplitude vibrato".

* __compress.r__: Creates a compressed version of the audio by sythesizing only using the STFT coefficients with the highest moduli.

* __echo.r__: Produces an echo using an AR filter.

* __filter.r__: A filter that that passes only frequencies between 1000 and 3000 Hz.

* __karplus-strong.r__: A simple implementation of the Kaplus-Strong string synthesis algorithm.

* __pitch_vibrato.r__: Creates a sine tone with pitch vibrato.

* __robotize.r__: "Robotizes" the input audio file.

* __whisperize.r__: "Whisperizes" the input audio file.
